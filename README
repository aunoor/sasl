Scriptable avionics modeling suite for flight simulators.

SASL features scriptable component model and flight simulation abstraction layer. Simulated avionics can be connected to virtually any flight simulator. Current version has networked X-Plane connector and X-Plane plugin which integrates SASL avionics and X-Plane aircrafts.


Compilation on Ubuntu/Linux
---------------------------

First you need to install all nesseccary packages:

$ sudo apt-get install zip build-essential g++ luajit libluajit-5.1-2 libluajit-5.1-dev libsdl1.2debian libsdl1.2-dev libopenal1 libopenal-dev libgl1-mesa-glx libgl1-mesa-dev libsoil1 libsoil-dev

You need to download and compile luajit to be able to link it statically.
First download and extract the sources of luajit somewhere outside of your sasl source directory:

$ wget http://luajit.org/download/LuaJIT-2.0.0-beta10.tar.gz
$ tar -xf LuaJIT-2.0.0-beta10.tar.gz
$ cd LuaJIT-2.0.0-beta10/
$ make

If everything went fine, you now should have a libluajit.a within LuaJIT-2.0.0-beta10/src/


Now we need to make our own conf.mk file:

$ cp conf-dist.mk conf.mk

in the conf.mk change:
XPSDK=[path to X-Plane SDK]
LUAJIT=/usr
LUAJIT_STATIC=[path to previously compiled libluajit.a]

if you are buiding on 64bit:
BUILD_64=yes

If you get errors stating that SOIL.h could not be found you can try to change the following in conf.mk:
EXTRA_CXXFLAGS=-I/usr/include/SOIL/

/usr/include/SOIL/ is the path to the libsoil include files. They might be somewhere else on your system.

You can use a shell script to compile it:

This one also creates zip-files under distr/ containing sasl, xap and the example aircraft:
$ ./mkdistr.sh

Or you can simply type:
$ make
